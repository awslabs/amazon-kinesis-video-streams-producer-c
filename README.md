## Key Features
Amazon Kinesis Video Streams Producer SDK for C/C++ makes it easy to build an on-device application that securely connects to a video stream, and reliably publishes video and other media data to Kinesis Video Streams. It takes care of all the underlying tasks required to package the frames and fragments generated by the device's media pipeline. The SDK also handles stream creation, token rotation for secure and uninterrupted streaming, processing acknowledgements returned by Kinesis Video Streams, and other tasks.

## Build
### Download
To download run the following command:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-c.git`

Note: If you miss running git clone with --recursive, run `git submodule update --init` in the amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-c/open-source directory
You will also need to install `pkg-config`, `automake` and `CMake` and a build enviroment

### Configure
Create a build directory in the newly checked out repository, and execute CMake from it.

`mkdir -p amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-c/build; cd amazon-kinesis-video-streams-producer-c/build; cmake .. `

By default we download all the libraries from GitHub and build them locally, so should require nothing to be installed ahead of time.
If you do wish to link to existing libraries you can use the following flags to customize your build.

#### Cross-Compilation

If you wish to cross-compile `CC` and `CXX` are respected when building the library and all its dependencies. See our [.travis.yml](.travis.yml) for an example of this. Every commit is cross compiled to ensure that it continues to work.


#### CMake Arguments
You can pass the following options to `cmake ..`.

* `-DBUILD_DEPENDENCIES` -- Whether or not to build depending libraries from source
* `-DBUILD_TEST=TRUE` -- Build unit/integration tests, may be useful for confirm support for your device. `./tst/producer_test`
* `-DCODE_COVERAGE` --  Enable coverage reporting
* `-DCOMPILER_WARNINGS` -- Enable all compiler warnings
* `-DADDRESS_SANITIZER` -- Build with AddressSanitizer
* `-DMEMORY_SANITIZER` --  Build with MemorySanitizer
* `-DTHREAD_SANITIZER` -- Build with ThreadSanitizer
* `-DUNDEFINED_BEHAVIOR_SANITIZER` Build with UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer
* `-DALIGNED_MEMORY_MODEL` Build for aligned memory model only devices. Default is OFF.

### Build
To build the library run make in the build directory you executed CMake.

`make`

### Run unit tests
Since these tests exercise networking you need to have AWS credentials specified, specifically you need to:

```
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<YourAWSSecretAccessKey>
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<YourAWSAccessKey>
```

Now you can execute the unit tests from the `build` directory as follows:
`./tst/producer_test`

## Development

The repository is using master branch as the aggregation and all of the feature development is done in appropriate feature branches. The PRs (Pull Requests) are cut on a feature branch and once approved with all the checks passed they can be merged by a click of a button on the PR tool. The master branch should always be build-able and all the tests should be passing. We are welcoming any contribution to the code base.

### Release
The repository is under active development and even with incremental unit test coverage where some of the tests are actually full integration tests, we require more rigorous internal testing in order to 'cut' release versions. The release is cut against a particular commit that gets approved. The general philosophy is to cut a release when a set of commits contribute to a self-containing feature or when we add major internal functionality improvements.

### Versioning
We deploy 3 digit version strings in a form of 'Major.Minor.Revision' scheme.
* Major version update - Major functionality changes. Might not have direct backward compatibility. For example, multiple public API parameter changes.
* Minor version update - Additional features. Major bug fixes. Might have some minor backward compatibility issues. For example, an extra parameter on a callback function.
* Revision version update - Minor features. Bug fixes. Full backward compatibility. For example, an extra fields added to the public structures with version bump.
